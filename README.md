# Budget-App
Simple Budget calculator application that i built while i was learning JavaScript.
this app allows us to add incomes and expenses for a certain month, and the app then calculates how much money we have made, and how much we spent, and then it gives us a nice budget.

## What i have learned:
* Modules pattern
* Advanced concepts about objects and functions in JavaScript
* DOM manipulations
* How to write a cleaner code and improve it
